Small project to try out some jQuery function and JS objects

The layout is very simple and boring because that was not the point. 
The only thing I was trying to do here is to understand how javaScript objects worked and how to interact with them.

I did this using pure javascript and jQuery.

Has always if you have any comments or maybe thing to add to make the code better or maybe to fallow best
practices feel free to comment or edit branches it out.
